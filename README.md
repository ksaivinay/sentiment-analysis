# sentiment-analysis
 In this project I collected a dataset from open source website named kaggle to conduct sentiment analysis. The dataset is amazon reviews dataset. Based on the reviews 
 given by the customers, the rating of the particular product is predicted. It is based on the words that are used for giving a review (Good, bad and average). Natural language 
 processing techniques are used in this project (stemming, removal of stopwords, lemmatization, tokenization). Libraries like pandas, NLTK, sklearn are also used. Random forest 
 classifier is used to predict the rating based on the reviews.
